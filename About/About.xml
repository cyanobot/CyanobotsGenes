    <description>7 new xenotypes and 47 new genes (16 cosmetic, 31 functional) to add to your gene pool. Requires Biotech.
        
Genes:
- 3 templates that generate genes dynamically from loaded xenotypes
--- Offspring: carriers have offspring of a different xenotype to themselves
--- Metamorphosis: carriers transform into a different xenotype at adulthood
--- Implanter: carriers can implant a specific xenotype into others (not necessarily their own)
- 2 hemogen-powered abilities
- Bodyfeeder gene for getting hemogen primarily from human flesh
- 5 diet genes: herbivores, carnivores, and obligate cannibals
- more/less/no Recreation need
- mental break threshold raised/lowered
- 3 body size genes
- 3 aging genes
- Precocious gene that allows infants to take care of themselves from birth
- genetic blindness/mutism
- 7 trait-forcing genes including 2 new traits
- claws, fangs, and tough skin
- 14 more miscellaneous
- head frills, tusks, and nostril slits
- tabby-patterned fur
- 2 tails
- 2 blood colors, 3 eye colors, 1 alternative eye graphic
- 3 hair bundles containing 17 hair colors
- 3 skin bundles containing 17 skin colors

Xenotypes:
- Biodrone : Emotionally dampened supersoldiers. Not quite as potent as Hussars, but far more controllable. Stoic and resilient, but inept at most non combat tasks.
- Changeling : Beautiful, flighty children found mysteriously without parents. They eat a lot, sleep a lot, and donâ€™t work hard, but everyone loves them.
- Fairy : The ironically named adult form of the changeling. Hulking, highly aggressive brutes with toxic spittle and great strength and speed.
- Glimmer (requires Outland - Genetics) : Hopelessly lost glitterworlders unsuited for life on the Rim. Intelligent, cheerful, intensely sociable, clumsy, herbivorous, and extremely distressed by violence.
- Kitlin : Useless cat people who spend all their time sleeping or playing. They are quick and agile and have a knack for shooting.
- Psycrux (requires VRE - Archon) : Intensely powerful psycasters and psychic parasites, able to implant others with a Thrall xenogerm to more readily enslave them and feed on their psyches.
- Thrall (requires VRE - Archon) : Created by Psycrux, thralls are easily controlled. They work most hours of the day, needing no recreation and little sleep, but they are slow in everything they do.
- Shulk : Highly specialised pioneers for settling remote cave systems. Self-sufficient with natural weapons for hunting, tough skin, strong immune systems and the ability to eat pretty much anything, but mute and extremely light sensitive.
- Wist : Hemogen-powered battlefield medics who use bloodfeeding to power coagulation and a potent, addictive, venomous bite that dulls pain, fights infection, and elevates mood.
